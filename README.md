Hey, it's me Luv (AKA Rujal Baniya). I participated in the Ideathon held at NBC, Lincoln University College. Here's a brief overview of what we did.

## Journey With VR: Travel, Share, Explore

**Journey With VR** is a tourism platform designed to support domestic travelers in documenting their journeys and sharing immersive experiences, reviews, and suggestions.

The **core feature** involves creating VR videos, allowing users to virtually experience these travels from the comfort of their homes.

This initiative aims to help people explore and promote local culture, heritage, and lifestyles, providing a similar **experience to those at home through VR**.

## Our Experiences
It was a great honor to participate in the Ideathon. I want to extend my respect to the organizer, **Mr. Jeteen Mandal**, and his team. The volunteer partners were up-to-date, active, and efficient.

Regarding our team:
- Me, the spelling killer
- Bibek, Sachin's food stealer
- Tamsan, the base model

Unfortunately, Sachin couldn't join us till the end due to personal issues, though it was quite helpful for Bibek to steal his food.
